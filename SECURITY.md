## Reporting a Vulnerability

I will try to fix the vulnerability within two weeks max. 
Please put your request in the Security section on Git, and I will take a look.
Please include as much information as possible, and don't bother me about my CORS policy; I am working on it.
Any CORS vulnerabilities will be fixed in the next major update.
